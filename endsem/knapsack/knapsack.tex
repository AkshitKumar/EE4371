\title{Modified Knapsack Problem}

\author{Akshit Kumar (EE14B127)}

\begin{abstract}
This report contains the code and the algorithm used for the first
question of the take home end-semester examination. The objective
of the problem is to find a subset of $N$ objects of positive weights
$\{w_{i}\}$that maximizes their sum subject to a different constraint
than the original knapsack constraint. Both a dynamic programming
and greedy solution is given to the problem in the question
